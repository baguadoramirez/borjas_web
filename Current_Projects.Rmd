  Previous studies have shown that the angle of approach is consistently overestimated for approaching (but passing-by) objects. An explanation based on a slow-motion prior has been proposed in the past to account for this bias. The mechanism relies on the (less reliable) in-depth component of the motion being more attracted towards the slow motion prior than the (more reliable) lateral component. This hypothesis predicts that faster speeds in depth will translate into a greater bias if the perception of velocity in depth follows Weber’s law.
  <br>
  <br>
  On this topic, my first paper “Perceived speed of motion in depth modulates misjudgements of approaching trajectories consistently with a slow prior” along with my  supervisor Joan López-Moliner was recently publish.

  So far, the study of the optic flow has been dominated by the ecological perspective. This current of thought postulates that although a problem can be specified in infinite ways, when certain parameters remain stable (e.g. fixed size), the amount of possible solutions to the same problem is reduced for a few mathematically formalized solutions.
  <br>
  <br>
  A paradigmatic example is the Tau model ($\tau$), which directly specifies the remaining time to contact as the ratio between size and expansion rate. However, an increasing body of research has shown that Tau's predictions do not match with interceptive behavior.
  <br>
  <br>
  In our project we aime to provide grounds for a 3D model in which prior knowledge of an object is used to calibrate the information in the optic flow. This way we could account for the computation of predictions about TTC and position of a flying object. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Since it is the subject of my doctoral thesis, it is the main active project of my career under the supervision of [Joan López-Moliner](http://www.ub.edu/viscagroup/joan/)

# Air Drag representation

  When we make a prediction about the future state of an object, we not only take into account its physical properties (weight, size, speed, shape or texture), we also use the properties of the environment in which the action occurs (gravitational acceleration or lighting direction).
  <br>
  <br>
  At the present time we know that the human uses a strong gravity prior on the speed of movement of the object. However, the dynamic effect of air drag is an unexplored area. To our knowledge, there is a gap in the literature about whether the human being uses a representation of air resistance to make predictions about the position, contact time or instantaneous velocity of an object. In fact, in many experiments, its effect is assumed to be negliigible. 
  <br>
  <br>
  To find out if this physical property is taken into account, I am preparing an experiment with [Björn Jorges](https://b-jorges.github.io/rmarkdown-website-tutorial/index.html) under the supervision of our supervisor [Joan López-Moliner](http://www.ub.edu/viscagroup/joan/).
